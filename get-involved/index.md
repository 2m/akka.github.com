                    Stack Overflow is a Q&amp;A site for programmers. Stack Overflow has a very active community of people asking and answering <a href="//stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/akka">questions about Akka</a>. Users can vote on each others' contributions and earn reputation points.

                <h3 class="bugs">Report bugs</h3>
                <a href="//github.com/akka/akka/issues">???+ bug reporters</a>
                <p>
                    Bug reports help Akka improve, so please report any issues you have! Akka uses <a href="//github.com/akka/akka/issues">GitHub to track issues</a>. When you report bugs, make sure you include lots of detail, including reproducible tests, example code or anything else you think might help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even if you're not ready to fix issues yourself just yet, you can help out by verifying issues that have been reported by others. Look for issues tagged with the <a href="//github.com/akka/akka/issues?labels=needs-verification"><span class="issueLabel">needs-verification</span> label</a>. You can assist by looking at these issues and doing some checking to confirm whether they're bugs or not. You could provide reproducible tests or a sample project, or even just ask the original reporter for more information.
                </p>

                <h3 class="patch">Patch the core</h3>
                <a href="//github.com/akka/akka/graphs/contributors">???+ committers</a>
                <p>
                    Akka's code and documentation is hosted on <a href="//github.com/akka/akka">Github</a>. It's easy to <a href="#">get the code and build Akka from source</a>. Akka development is discussed on the <a href="//groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/akka-user"><span class="mailingList">play-framework-dev</span> mailing list</a>. You can ask on the list if you have any questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You're welcome to work on any feature you like—Akka is open source after all!—but if you'd like some good ideas, look for issues tagged with the <a href="//github.com/akka/akka/issues?labels=community"><span class="issueLabel">community label</span></a>. These issues are ready and waiting for volunteers to pick them up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To keep our code tidy and to make sure we work together smoothly there are some <a href="#">Developer &amp; Contributor Guidelines</a> that you'll need to make sure you follow.
                </p>

                <h3 class="modules">Create modules</h3>
                <p>
                    You can add new features to Akka applications by creating a module. Writing new modules is often easier than patching Akka's core code. You can learn about creating modules for <a href="#">Scala</a> and <a href="#">Java</a>.
