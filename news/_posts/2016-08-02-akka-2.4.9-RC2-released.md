Dear hAkkers,

We—the Akka committers—are pleased to announce the availability of Akka 2.4.9-RC2.

This release does not change much over the previous Release Candidate, 
except fixing one OSGi plugin induced packaging problem which might have
caused compilation errors, see issue [#21105](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/21105)
if you want to know more about the root cause of the problem (it was related to `sbt-osgi`, 
which we have fixed in the plugin itself).

More details on what's coming in the 2.4.9 release are available in the [2.4.9-RC1 annoucement](http://akka.io/news/2016/08/02/akka-2.4.9-RC1-released.html).

We would like to ask you to try out this release candidate and report 
any issues via the mailing list, issues, or gitter chat if you find any.
